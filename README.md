# Sunday-in-the-Park-with-George

![](noise.png)

“Sunday in the Park with George” is a textural, interactive, three dimensional experience of Georges Seurat's two-dimensional "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte." Using Processing 3, this particle system engages with the narrative of George Seurat’s relationship with pointillism and how people considered his paintings to be failures because they didn't have any "life" or "depth," when in truth, his methodology and subject matter from his "perspective" were quite lively.
